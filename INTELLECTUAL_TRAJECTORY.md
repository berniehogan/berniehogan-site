# Bernie Hogan: Intellectual Trajectory Summary

## Overview

Bernie Hogan, Associate Professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, has evolved from pioneering social media theorist to critical platform scholar, consistently interrogating how technical infrastructures shape knowledge production and individual agency. His work represents a rare synthesis: **theoretically sophisticated frameworks that anticipate field-wide shifts** combined with **pragmatic technical interventions**.

**Key distinguishing features:**
- Introduced "algorithmic curation" to scholarly discourse in 2010
- Lead developer of Network Canvas ($7 million NIH-funded software suite, winner of Best Software at INSNA 2024)
- Director of Oxford's MSc in Social Data Science
- Over 7,945 Google Scholar citations
- Prophetic trajectory: warned about Facebook data risks in 2018 CBC interview before Cambridge Analytica scandal

## The Through Line

The trajectory connecting Bernie's work shows remarkable consistency: **technical architectures don't just shape but constitute social possibilities**.

### Phase 1: Performances to Exhibitions (2010)
The "Presentation of Self in the Age of Social Media" paper extended Goffman's dramaturgical framework by identifying a new form of power: **asynchronous "exhibitions" of digital artifacts curated by platform algorithms**. The platform itself acts as curator, deciding what content surfaces, when, and to whom.

### Phase 2: Algorithmic Curation and Platform Power (2010-2015)
Coined "algorithmic curation" before most people understood what was happening. Named "invisible algorithms" and the "real name web" - concepts others experienced but hadn't conceptualized.

### Phase 3: API Closure and Epistemic Capture (2018)
"Social Media Giveth, Social Media Taketh Away" introduced **relational generativity** - platforms don't just restrict data access, they eliminate the capacity to produce alternative representations of social structure. The **"maps versus routes" metaphor** crystallizes the difference between user empowerment and algorithmic control.

### Phase 4: Networks as Power (2021-present)
Networks aren't discovered, they're enacted. The act of formalizing connections through network analysis is itself a form of power. This leads to current work on semantic structures and AI interpretability.

### Phase 5: Semantic Structures and Vector Pragmatics (current)
The work on "proper likeness," sheaf-theoretic understandings of semantic spaces, and the "Autoencoder's Dilemma" - exploring how meaning works (and fails to work) technically. A scale-free theory of meaning that connects to AI alignment debates about local coherence versus forced globalization.

## Key Theoretical Contributions

1. **Algorithmic Curation** (2010) - Platforms as active curators, not neutral hosts
2. **Relational Generativity** - Platforms' systematic capture of users' network data
3. **Maps vs Routes** - User-generated understanding vs. algorithmic direction
4. **Epistemic Capture** - Technical architectures constraining what can be known
5. **Vector Pragmatics** - Sheaf-theoretic approach to meaning (in development)

## Key Practical Contributions

1. **Network Canvas** - $7M NIH-funded software for network data collection
2. **MSc in Social Data Science** - Curriculum development and direction
3. **From Social Science to Data Science** - Textbook bridging disciplines

## Distinctive Positioning

Bernie's approach refuses to separate technical from theoretical or practical from critical:
- Network Canvas isn't just useful; it embodies theoretical commitments about empowerment
- Algorithmic curation isn't just analysis; it names a power dynamic to make it contestable
- The formalization deepens rather than dilutes understanding

**What makes this distinctive:**
- Strategic publication positioning: theoretically groundbreaking papers in accessible venues
- Genuine interdisciplinarity: sociology, computer science, public health, geography
- Anticipatory theorizing: naming phenomena before they become widely understood
- Building infrastructure, not just papers

## Publication Themes for Website

The same work should appear under multiple themes with different framings. Key works and their multi-thematic nature:

**High cross-listing potential:**
- "Social Media Giveth, Social Media Taketh Away" (Platforms/Epistemology/Semantic)
- "The Presentation of Self in the Age of Social Media" (Platforms/Epistemology)
- Network Canvas papers (Methods/Epistemology)
- Likeness papers on SSRN/ArXiv (Semantic/Epistemology)

**Theme-specific works:**
- Statistical collaborations → Methods and Tools
- Teaching materials → Teaching and Translation
- Book chapters → Teaching and Translation / Networks as Epistemology

## Notes for Claude Code Implementation

When building this website:
1. The structure demonstrates the argument - don't explain it
2. Keep annotations terse (2-3 sentences) but theme-specific
3. Let multi-thematic placement emerge naturally from the work
4. Austere aesthetic: complexity through discovery, not presentation
5. Trust that smart readers will see the pattern
