## 1. Platforms and Power

Works assigned to this theme emphasize how technical architectures shape what can be known: algorithmic curation, API closure, epistemic capture, political economy, infrastructure critique.

---

### The Presentation of Self in the Age of Social Media (2010)
**Hogan** | Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society | 1,752 citations
*[ALREADY COMPLETE — existing annotation retained]*

> Extends Goffman's dramaturgical framework to identify a new form of power in social media: the platform as curator. Unlike synchronous performances before co-present audiences, social media creates asynchronous "exhibitions" where algorithms decide what surfaces, when, and to whom.

---

### Social Media Giveth, Social Media Taketh Away (2018)
**Hogan** | International Journal of Communication | 40 citations
*[ALREADY COMPLETE — existing annotation retained]*

> Facebook's progressive API restrictions eliminated researchers' and users' capacity to access their own social graph data. This wasn't a privacy feature — it was monopolization of the means of representation. Introduces "relational generativity" to describe platforms' systematic capture of users' network data.

---

### Persistence and Change in Social Media (2010)
**Hogan, Quan-Haase** | Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society | 310 citations

> Identifies persistent social practices and long-term trajectories that underlie the seeming chaos of everyday social media use. Despite platform-specific affordances, enduring patterns of interaction reveal how technical infrastructure constrains and channels social behavior across platforms, users, and cultures.

---

### Uneven Geographies of User-Generated Information (2014)
**Graham, Hogan, Straumann, Medhat** | Annals of the Association of American Geographers | 256 citations

> Demonstrates that internet connectivity alone cannot remedy global informational inequality — some regions remain systematically underrepresented in user-generated content despite adequate infrastructure. Wikipedia's geographic coverage reveals how the platform's architecture and existing power structures reproduce and amplify real-world inequalities in knowledge production.

---

### Racial and Ethnic Biases in Rental Housing (2011)
**Hogan, Berry** | City & Community | 138 citations

> An audit study of Toronto Craigslist rental listings showing that "opportunity-denying" discrimination — landlords simply not responding to racialized names — was ten times more common than overt hostility. The platform's architecture, by enabling anonymous screening of applicants through email, creates new infrastructures for discrimination that operate through non-response rather than explicit exclusion.

---

### Overcoming Digital Divides in Higher Education (2016)
**Radovanovic, Hogan, Lalic** | New Media & Society | 132 citations

> Applies Weber's theory of stratification to the digital divide in Serbian higher education, finding that platform literacy — not mere access — determines who benefits from digital tools. The gap between students and instructors in digital skills creates hierarchies of competence that mirror and reinforce existing institutional power structures.

---

### Pseudonyms and the Rise of the Real-Name Web (2012)
**Hogan** | A Companion to New Media Dynamics (Blackwell) | 116 citations

> The shift from pseudonymous to real-name platforms represents a specific political turn, not a natural evolution of the web. Real-name policies like Google+'s and Facebook's solve a problem for platform owners — unified data profiles — while eliminating users' capacity to manage collapsed contexts, effectively forcing a single global identity where multiple local ones previously served.

---

### Digital Inequalities 2.0: Legacy Inequalities in the Information Age (2020)
**Robinson, Hogan et al.** | First Monday | 104 citations

> Twenty-five years after "the digital divide" was first identified, foundational access inequalities persist across class, gender, race, disability, and geography. Introduces the "digital inequality stack" — from connectivity infrastructure through devices, skills, and production capacity — showing how platform architectures layer new forms of exclusion atop legacy disparities.

---

### Digital Inequalities 3.0: Emergent Inequalities in the Information Age (2020)
**Robinson, Hogan et al.** | First Monday | 30 citations

> Companion to the 2.0 paper, focusing on novel inequalities spawned by the platform economy: algorithmic bias, automation-driven precarity, big data asymmetries, cybersafety gaps, and differential emotional well-being. These emergent inequalities are not merely extensions of old divides but structurally new forms of disadvantage created by platform architectures themselves.

---

### A Global Shift in the Social Relationships of Networked Individuals (2011)
**Hogan, Dutton, Li** | Oxford Internet Institute Technical Report | 98 citations

> Cross-national survey of 17 countries reveals online dating as complement rather than substitute for offline meeting, with adoption highest among those over 40 re-entering the dating market. Platforms mediate who meets whom at scale, reconfiguring the opportunity structures for intimate relationship formation in ways that vary by age, gender, and cultural context.

---

### LGBTQ Youth Identity Management on Facebook (2018)
**McConnell, Neray, Hogan et al.** | IJERPH | 66 citations

> LGBTQ youth must navigate Facebook's architecture of enforced singular identity when their social reality requires selective disclosure to different audiences. The platform's collapsed context — presenting one profile to family, school, and queer community simultaneously — forces identity management strategies that range from uniformly "out" to carefully segmented, revealing how real-name platforms become sites of involuntary disclosure.

---

### How Canadians' Use of the Internet Affects Social Life and Civic Engagement (2008)
**Veenhof, Wellman, Quell, Hogan** | Statistics Canada | 59 citations

> *[See Networks as Epistemology — primary theme]*

---

### Computer Mediated Communication in Intimate Relationships (2017)
**Norton, Baptist, Hogan** | Journal of Marital and Family Therapy | 42 citations

> Examines how platform affordances create new vectors for relationship boundary violation — online boundary crossing is linked to lower relationship satisfaction and partner responsiveness. The technological mediation of intimate relationships doesn't merely digitize existing dynamics; it introduces structurally new forms of intrusion enabled by always-on platform connectivity.

---

### How Facebook Divides Us (2016)
**Hogan** | Times Literary Supplement | Public piece

> Facebook's algorithmic filtering actively hides friends' views most likely to provoke disagreement, yielding "a doctored account of their personalities." This isn't a side effect but a design choice — the platform could use its knowledge of users to bridge divides, but instead optimizes for engagement by minimizing friction, systematically fragmenting shared reality.

---

### Was Facebook's Decision to Cut Off Third-Party Developers Genuinely Virtuous? (2018)
**Hogan** | New Statesman | Public piece

> In the wake of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook framed its API restrictions as a privacy measure. But this narrative obscures a simpler truth: closing third-party access while maintaining proprietary data monopoly is a power consolidation move dressed up as user protection. The platform's response to its own failures further entrenched its epistemic dominance.

---

### Facebook (encyclopedia entry) (2011)
**Hogan, Smith** | Encyclopedia of Social Networks (Sage)

> Provides an overview of Facebook's technical architecture and its implications for social network analysis, at a moment when the platform was still relatively open to researchers. Documents the affordances and constraints of the platform in its pre-API-closure era, a baseline against which subsequent data monopolization can be measured.

---

### Social Media (encyclopedia entry) (2015)
**Hogan, Melville** | International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences

> Defines and contextualizes social media platforms as technical systems with specific affordances for many-to-many communication, distinguishing them from earlier digital communication tools. Establishes a conceptual vocabulary for understanding how these platforms mediate social interaction at scale.

---

### Mixing in Social Media (2015)
**Hogan** | Social Media + Society | 5 citations

> Uses the social life of vinyl records as an analogy to reconceptualize social media as many-to-many affordances rather than a unified technology suite. This reframing highlights how platform design choices about mixing — what content surfaces alongside what other content — shape users' informational environments in ways that are invisible but consequential.

---

### Comment on Elena Pavan/1: Considering Platforms as Actors (2013)
**Hogan** | Sociologica | 6 citations

> Argues that platforms must be understood as actors in network analysis, not merely as neutral infrastructure through which social action flows. Their algorithms, APIs, and personalization features actively shape the networks they host, making the platform itself a node of power rather than a passive medium.

---

### Assessing Structural Correlates between Friendship Networks and Conversational Agency in Facebook Groups (2015)
**Polonski, Hogan** | ICWSM | 7 citations

> Examines how pre-existing friendship ties structure conversation within Facebook groups, finding that network position shapes who speaks and who is heard. Platform-mediated group dynamics don't simply mirror offline social structures — they create new patterns of conversational agency where structural position in the friendship network amplifies or dampens voice.

---

### The Relational Self-Portrait: Selfies Meet Social Networks (2014)
**Hogan, Wellman** | Society and the Internet (Oxford) | 30 citations

> Social networking sites encourage users to construct "relational self-portraits" — dynamic, selective digital selves that exist only through connections to others. The platform's architecture determines what aspects of identity become visible and to whom, making self-representation inseparable from the technical infrastructure that mediates it.

---

### From Invisible Algorithms to Interactive Affordances (2015)
**Hogan** | Roles, Trust, and Reputation in Social Media Knowledge Markets (Springer) | 23 citations

> Critiques the shift from transparent ordering (alphabetical, chronological) to opaque machine learning-driven curation of online information. Argues that invisible algorithmic sorting represents an ideological choice — not a neutral optimization — and explores alternative interactive affordances that could return agency to users through graph-based data presentation.

---

### The Break-Up and the Limits of Encoding Love (2018)
**Hogan** | A Networked Self and Love (Routledge) | 5 citations

> Platforms encode relationships as static links that persist after lived relationships end — "it's complicated" is Facebook's closest approximation to the chaos of a breakup. The gap between performed love and exhibited relationship status reveals how platform ontologies flatten the complexity of intimate life into machine-readable categories that serve the platform's logic, not the users'.

---

### First-Generation Students and College (2016)
**Jeon, Ellison, Greenhow, Hogan** | CSCW | 25 citations | Honorable Mention

> The College Connect application used Facebook's social graph to visualize prospective college students' networks, with social media information access being significant only for first-generation students — those with the least institutional knowledge. Platform data, when made legible to users rather than hoarded by the platform, can redistribute informational advantage.

---

### Uneven Openness: Barriers to MENA Representation on Wikipedia (2013)
**Graham, Hogan** | IDRC Technical Report | 12 citations

> Maps persistent information asymmetries between the MENA region and the developed world on Wikipedia, finding that "openness" of a platform does not guarantee equitable participation. Structural barriers — linguistic, political, and infrastructural — mean that nominally open platforms reproduce existing geopolitical hierarchies of knowledge production.

---

### Wikipedia Arabe et la Construction Collective du Savoir (2015)
**Allagui, Graham, Hogan** | Presses Universitaires de Paris Ouest

> Examines low participation in and limited content within Arabic Wikipedia as a case study in how platform architecture interacts with linguistic, political, and infrastructural barriers to produce systematic knowledge gaps. The collective construction of knowledge is only as democratic as the conditions of participation allow.

---

### Digital Divisions of Labour and Informational Magnetism (2015)
**Graham, Straumann, Hogan** | Annals of the Association of American Geographers | 67 citations

> Maps Wikipedia participation to reveal "informational magnetism" — the tendency for knowledge production to cluster around existing economic cores, creating virtuous cycles for the center and vicious cycles for the periphery. The relative democratization of internet access has not produced a concurrent democratization of voice and representation on platforms.

---

### Interactive Mapping of Wikipedia's Geographies (2012)
**Baily, Hogan, Graham, Medhat** | WikiSym '12

> Presents an interactive visualization tool mapping every geolocated Wikipedia article worldwide, making visible the stark asymmetries in geographic representation. The tool itself serves as a demonstration that platform data, when made accessible through alternative interfaces, can reveal structural inequalities that the platform's own interface obscures.

---

### Sexting among British Adults (2022)
**Macdowall, Reid, Lewis et al.** | Culture, Health & Sexuality | 1 citation

> Qualitative analysis of 34 British adults' sexting experiences reveals how platform affordances shape intimate digital communication as "emotion work" governed by feeling rules around trust, desire, and shame. The technical mediation of intimate exchange creates new norms and vulnerabilities that don't exist in unmediated contexts.

---

### The Relationship between Zoom Use with the Camera On and Zoom Fatigue (2022)
**Ngien, Hogan** | Information, Communication & Society | 7 citations

> Investigates the mechanisms linking camera-on Zoom use to mental exhaustion, finding that self-monitoring and social interaction anxiety mediate the relationship. The platform's architecture of mandatory mutual visibility — unlike telephone or text — imposes a specific cognitive and emotional burden that is unevenly distributed across personality types.

---

## 2. Methods and Tools

Works assigned to this theme emphasize building infrastructure for better data collection: Network Canvas, egocentric networks, participant-aided sociograms, pragmatic methodology, software development.

---

### Visualizing Personal Networks: Working with Participant-Aided Sociograms (2007)
**Hogan, Carrasco, Wellman** | Field Methods | 472 citations

> Introduces participant-aided sociograms as an interview-based data collection method that extends traditional name generators by having respondents place alters on a visual diagram. Demonstrates both practical and methodological advantages of keeping "high technology in the lab and low technology in the field" — paper-based sociograms reduce respondent burden while capturing richer structural data than standard survey instruments.

---

### Collecting Social Network Data to Study Social Activity-Travel (2007)
**Carrasco, Hogan, Wellman, Miller** | Environment and Planning B | 413 citations

> Develops a data collection instrument that explicitly links social networks to travel behavior through an egocentric approach, testing the hypothesis that individuals' travel is conditional on their social network structure. Demonstrates how survey and interview methods can be designed to capture the social dimension that transportation research had largely ignored.

---

A methodological blueprint for studying networked individualism through mixed-methods approaches that capture both network structure and lived experience.

---

### Assessing Structural Correlates to Social Capital in Facebook Personal Networks (2014)
**Brooks, Hogan, Ellison, Lampe, Vitak** | Social Networks | 153 citations

> Addresses a surprising gap: prior work correlated Facebook use with social capital, but social capital is inherently structural, and little work related it to actual network structure. Uses Facebook ego network data to demonstrate how structural features of online networks — density, clustering, bridging — map onto different dimensions of social capital.

---

### Agency in Social Activity and ICT Interactions (2008)
**Carrasco, Hogan, Wellman, Miller** | Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie | 133 citations

> Develops methods for modeling interactions among face-to-face and electronic communication modes, demonstrating how ICT use patterns can be captured alongside travel behavior data. The data collection framework treats communication mode choice as a methodological variable, enabling researchers to study how different media serve different social network functions.

---

### Evaluating Paper-to-Screen Translation of Participant-Aided Sociograms (2016)
**Hogan, Melville, Phillips et al.** | CHI 2016 | 50 citations

> Evaluates the digital translation of paper-based participant-aided sociograms to a touchscreen interface for use with high-risk populations (young MSM in Chicago). Finds that the screen-based tool produces comparable network data while reducing interviewer burden, validating the move from paper to the Network Canvas platform without sacrificing data quality.

---

### A Comparison of On and Offline Networks through the Facebook API (2009)
**Hogan** | QMSS2 Conference | 37 citations

> Early methodological work using the Facebook API to extract and compare egocentric network structures, demonstrating that online friendship networks — while larger — exhibit structural properties (clustering, density) that meaningfully correspond to offline social organization. Establishes the viability of platform APIs as tools for social network research.

---

### Online Social Networks: Concepts for Data Collection and Analysis (2016)
**Hogan** | SAGE Handbook of Online Research Methods, 2nd ed. | 33 citations

> Updated methodological guide for collecting and analyzing online social network data, reflecting the significant changes in platform architectures since the first edition. Addresses the growing tension between researchers' analytical needs and platforms' progressive restriction of data access.

---

### Assessing the Stability of Ego-Centered Networks over Time Using Network Canvas (2020)
**Hogan, Janulis, Phillips et al.** | Network Science | 26 citations

> Tests whether apparent instability in egocentric networks across survey waves reflects genuine network churn or interview artifacts like anchoring and motivated underreporting. Uses Network Canvas to demonstrate that structural embeddedness predicts alter retention, providing empirical grounding for interpreting longitudinal ego network data.

---

### Network Canvas: Key Decisions in the Design (2021)
**Birkett, Melville, Janulis et al.** | Social Networks | 23 citations

> Documents the key design decisions behind the Network Canvas software suite — Architect (protocol design), Interviewer (touch-optimized data collection), and Server (deployment management). Prioritizes usability and accessibility across platforms, addressing the chronic problem that self-reported social network studies are complex and burdensome for both researchers and participants.

---

### Network Canvas: An Open-Source Tool (2023)
**Janulis, Phillips, Melville, Hogan, Birkett** | International Journal of Epidemiology

> Introduces Network Canvas to the epidemiological community as an end-to-end open-source workflow for designing and conducting network interviews. Provides an accessible entry point for health researchers who need social network data but lack the technical infrastructure to build custom data collection tools.

---

### A Scale for Measuring Email Overload (2006)
**Hogan, Fisher** | Microsoft Research Technical Report | 28 citations

> Develops and validates an eight-item survey scale for measuring email overload, showing it links well to actual user behavior across 292 subjects. A pragmatic methodological contribution that provides a standardized instrument for evaluating email management systems and studying workplace communication patterns.

---

### Avoiding GIGO: Learnings from Data Collection in Innovation Research (2020)
**Roden, Lusher, Spurling et al.** | Social Networks | 9 citations

> Candidly documents the data collection failures of a social network study of university-industry collaboration in controlled radical polymerization, extracting transferable lessons about flexibility and adaptability in network data collection. A rare honest account of methodological failure that serves the field better than another success story.

---

### Visualising and Interpreting Facebook Networks (2010)

> Provides practical guidance for visualizing and interpreting Facebook network data using the NodeXL platform, translating social network analysis techniques for a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. Demonstrates how network visualization tools can make structural patterns in social media data legible and analytically useful.

---

### Network Approach for Local Governance of Energy (2013)
**Parag, Hamilton, White, Hogan** | Energy Policy | 129 citations

> Applies social network analysis to map information and financial support exchanges between low-carbon community groups and other actors in Oxfordshire, UK. Demonstrates how network methods can illuminate the meso-level governance structures that shape local energy transitions — making visible the relational infrastructure that policy analysis typically ignores.

---

### Conversations about Conservation (2019)
**Hamilton, Hogan, Lucas, Mayne** | Energy Research & Social Science | 9 citations

> Uses mixed-method social network analysis across 85 interviews in six UK communities to understand how conversations influence energy practices. Identifies social factors that "open up" or "close down" energy discussions, including perceived stigma — showing how network methods can reveal the social dynamics underlying behavioral change.

---

### Modelling the Evolution of Continuously-Observed Networks (2011)
**Opsahl, Hogan** | arXiv | 18 citations

> Develops a conditional logistic framework for modeling tie creation in continuously-observed networks, enabling simultaneous estimation of multiple growth mechanisms (homophily, reciprocity, triadic closure, popularity). Applied to a Facebook-like community, the method advances beyond panel-data approaches to capture the fine-grained temporal dynamics of network evolution.

---

### A Time Decoupling Approach for Studying Forum Dynamics (2013)
**Kan, Chan, Hayes, Hogan, Bailey, Leckie** | World Wide Web | 17 citations

> Proposes decoupling temporal information about forum users into event sequences and inter-event times, creating a novel feature space for analyzing communication patterns. Applied to 30,000+ users across four internet forums, the method reveals communication dynamics invisible to traditional approaches, including novel patterns in how users engage over time.

---

### Using Social Metadata in Email Triage (2007)
**Fisher, Brush, Hogan, Smith, Jacobs** | Human Interface and the Management of Information (Springer) | 19 citations

> Explores how social network metadata extracted from email headers can be used to help users prioritize their inbox, leveraging the social structure embedded in communication patterns. A practical demonstration of how network analysis methods can improve information management tools.

---

### Racial and Ethnic Biases in Rental Housing (2011)
**Hogan, Berry** | City & Community | 138 citations

> Develops an innovative audit methodology using 5,620 fictitious email inquiries sent to Craigslist landlords, each landlord receiving inquiries from five racialized name categories. The method enables large-scale discrimination testing at low cost by leveraging the affordances of online platforms for systematic field experiments.

---

### OxCOVID19 Database (2021)
**Mahdi, Blaszczyk, Dlotko et al.** | Scientific Reports | 9 citations

> Develops a comprehensive multimodal data repository integrating epidemiological, governmental, mobility, and weather data across countries at national and regional levels. A large-scale data infrastructure project demonstrating how interdisciplinary collaboration can produce research tools that serve the broader scientific community during a crisis.

---

### Online Sexual Partner Seeking as a Social Practice (2022)
**Reid, Macdowall, Lewis et al.** | Journal of Sex Research | 1 citation

Applies a social practice framework to a sensitive research domain, demonstrating how qualitative methods can complement large-scale survey data.

---

### From Social Science to Data Science (2023)
**Hogan** | Sage Publications | Book

> *[See Teaching and Translation — primary theme]*

---

## 3. Semantic Structures

Works assigned to this theme emphasize how meaning works (and fails to work) technically: the autoencoder dilemma, vector pragmatics, proper likeness, formal/mathematical approaches, AI interpretability.

---

### Social Media Giveth, Social Media Taketh Away (2018)
**Hogan** | International Journal of Communication | 40 citations
*[ALREADY COMPLETE — existing annotation retained]*

> API closure demonstrates epistemic capture at infrastructure level. Users' social networks exist as local, context-dependent perceptions, but platforms force these into single global representations. An early example of the tension between local coherence and forced globalization that appears later in LLM alignment debates.

---

### The Break-Up and the Limits of Encoding Love (2018)
**Hogan** | A Networked Self and Love (Routledge) | 5 citations

> The relationship between lived experience and its platform encoding reveals a fundamental semantic gap: "it's complicated" is the richest category Facebook offers for the dissolution of a partnership. The forced mapping from continuous emotional states to discrete database categories exemplifies the broader problem of how technical ontologies flatten meaning — a problem that scales from relationship status to identity writ large.

---

### Pseudonyms and the Rise of the Real-Name Web (2012)
**Hogan** | A Companion to New Media Dynamics (Blackwell) | 116 citations

> The nymwars reveal a deep semantic problem: identity is contextually performed and locally coherent, but real-name policies force a single canonical referent. The pseudonym solved the technical problem of context-dependent meaning by allowing different names in different contexts — its elimination collapses the many-to-one mapping between social roles and encoded identity.

---

### From Invisible Algorithms to Interactive Affordances (2015)
**Hogan** | Roles, Trust, and Reputation in Social Media Knowledge Markets (Springer) | 23 citations

> Machine learning-driven curation replaces explicit ordering logics (alphabetical, chronological) with opaque personalized relevance, severing the relationship between structure and meaning. Proposes data-as-graphs as an alternative paradigm — making the relationships between items visible and navigable rather than hiding them behind black-box recommendation systems.

---

### Using Platform Signals for Distinguishing Discourses (2019)
**LaViolette, Hogan** | ICWSM | 34 citations

> Demonstrates how the same words ("men's rights," "discrimination," "equality") arrive at radically different meanings in r/MensRights versus r/MensLib through the integration of platform metadata ("platform signals") with text classification. Shows that semantic meaning cannot be recovered from text alone — the context encoded in platform structures (voting patterns, cross-posting networks, moderator actions) is essential for disambiguation.

---

### Me, Myself, and ID: Encoding Identities from Real Names to Deepfakes (2024)
**Hogan** | Oxford University Press | Book (under contract)

> Traces the technical history of identity encoding from naming conventions through biometrics to synthetic media, examining how each encoding regime creates new possibilities and new failures of representation. The progression from real names to deepfakes is not merely a technological trajectory but a story about the increasingly unstable relationship between signifier and referent in digital identity systems.

---

### Measuring the Predictability of Life Outcomes with Scientific Mass Collaboration (2020)
**Salganik, Hogan et al.** | PNAS | 199 citations

> A mass collaboration of 160 teams using machine learning on rich longitudinal data (Fragile Families) found that life outcomes remain stubbornly unpredictable — the best models barely exceeded simple benchmarks. This reveals a fundamental limit of representation: even comprehensive feature spaces cannot encode the complexity that determines individual trajectories, challenging the assumption that more data yields proportionally more predictive power.

---

### A Time Decoupling Approach for Studying Forum Dynamics (2013)
**Kan, Chan, Hayes, Hogan, Bailey, Leckie** | World Wide Web | 17 citations

> Develops a formal method for separating temporal user behavior into event sequences and inter-event time distributions, creating a new feature space that captures communicative patterns invisible to conventional analysis. The decoupling approach reveals that the meaningful structure in forum participation lies not in what users say but in the temporal signature of how they engage — a formal insight into the semantics of participation rhythms.

---

## 4. Networks as Epistemology

Works assigned to this theme emphasize what networks reveal about knowledge production: relational generativity, maps vs routes, CSS reframing, philosophy of social science.

---

### The Presentation of Self in the Age of Social Media (2010)
**Hogan** | Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society | 1,752 citations
*[ALREADY COMPLETE — existing annotation retained]*

> Introduces the performance/exhibition distinction that reframes how we understand mediated self-presentation. The shift from real-time interaction to curated display fundamentally changes what can be known about social actors and how that knowledge is produced.

---

### Social Media Giveth, Social Media Taketh Away (2018)
**Hogan** | International Journal of Communication | 40 citations
*[ALREADY COMPLETE — existing annotation retained]*

> Platforms don't just restrict data access — they eliminate the capacity to produce alternative representations of social structure. By closing APIs while maintaining proprietary access, Facebook ensures only their algorithmic "routes" exist, never user-generated "maps." A case study in how technical architecture becomes epistemological constraint.

---

### Visualizing Personal Networks: Working with Participant-Aided Sociograms (2007)
**Hogan, Carrasco, Wellman** | Field Methods | 472 citations

> The participant-aided sociogram is not merely a data collection tool — it is an epistemological intervention. By having respondents place alters on a diagram and draw connections, it produces knowledge about social structure that is fundamentally different from name-generator lists: spatial, relational, and co-constructed between researcher and participant.

---

### Collecting Social Network Data to Study Social Activity-Travel (2007)
**Carrasco, Hogan, Wellman, Miller** | Environment and Planning B | 413 citations

> Demonstrates that travel behavior — seemingly a matter of individual choice and geography — is fundamentally structured by social networks. By making networks visible in transportation data, the study reveals a relational dimension of spatial behavior that individualistic models systematically miss, showing how the lens of analysis determines what can be known.

---

### Connected Lives: The Project (2006)
**Wellman, Hogan, Berg et al.** | Networked Neighborhoods (Springer) | 242 citations

> The Connected Lives project operationalizes "networked individualism" as a researchable paradigm, showing that community is better understood through individual network structures than through geographic or group-based categories. What counts as "community" depends on the unit of analysis — the network lens reveals patterns that group-based and place-based approaches cannot capture.

---

### Uneven Geographies of User-Generated Information (2014)
**Graham, Hogan, Straumann, Medhat** | Annals of the Association of American Geographers | 256 citations

> Wikipedia's uneven geographic coverage is not merely a data quality problem — it is an epistemological one. The places that remain informationally impoverished on the platform become invisible in any analysis that takes Wikipedia as representative, creating a feedback loop where the absence of knowledge about a place ensures continued absence.

---

### Assessing Structural Correlates to Social Capital in Facebook Personal Networks (2014)
**Brooks, Hogan, Ellison, Lampe, Vitak** | Social Networks | 153 citations

> Brings structural network analysis to the social capital debate, demonstrating that the relationship between Facebook use and social capital only becomes intelligible when ego network structure is examined. The structural lens reveals that not all Facebook connections are equal — bridging ties, clustering, and density produce different forms of social capital, invisible to frequency-of-use measures.

---

### The Immanent Internet (2004)
**Wellman, Hogan** | Netting Citizens (St Andrew's Press) | 118 citations

> Argues that the internet has become "immanent" — woven into everyday life rather than a separate sphere — fundamentally changing the nature of citizenship and social participation. The concept of immanence reframes how we study the internet: not as a technology with effects, but as an infrastructure through which social life is increasingly constituted.

---

### The Immanent Internet Redux (2011)
**Hogan, Wellman** | Digital Religion, Social Media and Culture (Peter Lang) | 50 citations

> Updates the immanent internet thesis for the mobile and social media era, noting that "the ethereal internet light that previously dazzled has now dimmed to a soft glow permeating everyday concerns." The internet's increasing invisibility as infrastructure paradoxically makes its epistemological effects harder to identify — the more immanent it becomes, the more it shapes what counts as knowledge without being recognized as doing so.

---

### Socioeconomic Inequality, Education and Social Capital (2011)
**Brooks, Hogan, Titsworth, Welser** | Information, Communication & Society | 70 citations

> Examines how socioeconomic status shapes access to beneficial network resources, showing that the relationship between position in social structure and social capital is mediated by the networks through which resources flow. The network perspective reveals that inequality is not merely a matter of individual attributes but of differential positioning in relational systems.

---

### Digital Divisions of Labour and Informational Magnetism (2015)
**Graham, Straumann, Hogan** | Annals of the Association of American Geographers | 67 citations

> "Informational magnetism" describes how knowledge production on Wikipedia gravitates toward existing economic cores, creating self-reinforcing cycles. This is an epistemological finding, not merely a distributional one: the geography of who produces knowledge determines what knowledge exists, and network effects ensure that initial advantages compound.

---

### LGBTQ Youth Identity Management on Facebook (2018)
**McConnell, Neray, Hogan et al.** | IJERPH | 66 citations

> Network analysis of LGBTQ youth reveals how different audience segments within a single Facebook ego network create competing demands for identity performance. The network structure itself — the degree to which different social circles overlap or remain distinct — determines what kind of self-knowledge is possible in mediated environments.

---

### How Canadians' Use of the Internet Affects Social Life and Civic Engagement (2008)
**Veenhof, Wellman, Quell, Hogan** | Statistics Canada | 59 citations

> Large-scale survey data reveals that internet users spend more time alone yet are at least as socially engaged as non-users — a paradox only resolvable through network analysis. What looks like social isolation through one lens (time-use data) looks like networked participation through another (communication patterns), demonstrating that the framework determines the finding.

### Assessing the Stability of Ego-Centered Networks over Time Using Network Canvas (2020)
**Hogan, Janulis, Phillips et al.** | Network Science | 26 citations

> The instability of nominated network alters across survey waves raises a fundamental epistemological question: does the network change, or does the measurement change? By testing whether structural embeddedness predicts alter retention, this study distinguishes genuine network dynamics from measurement artifacts — the answer to "what is the network?" depends on how and when you look.

---

### First-Generation Students and College (2016)
**Jeon, Ellison, Greenhow, Hogan** | CSCW | 25 citations

> Social media information access was significant only for first-generation students — those whose parents lacked college knowledge — demonstrating that the epistemological value of network connections is inversely related to institutional access. Networks don't just transmit information; they constitute it differently for differently positioned actors.

---

### Using Information Networks to Understand Social Behavior (2007)
**Hogan** | IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin | 20 citations

> Bridges data engineering and social science by arguing that information networks — the patterns in email, messaging, and online interaction — provide a distinct epistemological window onto social behavior. What networks reveal about social life is not a subset of what surveys reveal; it is a fundamentally different kind of knowledge.

---

### Networks Are a Lens for Power (2021)
**Hogan** | Social Networks | 5 citations

> Argues that networks are not merely analytical tools but systematizing devices with power in their own right — Facebook, X, and LinkedIn are networks of data representing people. The critical question is not only "what can networks tell us?" but "do the networks constrain us?" — recognizing that the lens of analysis is never neutral.

---

### A Global Shift in the Social Relationships of Networked Individuals (2011)
**Hogan, Dutton, Li** | Oxford Internet Institute Technical Report | 98 citations

> Cross-national data on online dating reveals that platforms don't merely facilitate existing relationship-seeking patterns — they restructure who can know whom. The finding that online dating complements rather than substitutes for offline meeting challenges the binary framing of "online vs. offline" and reveals a more networked epistemology of intimacy.

---

### The Internet in Everyday Life (2004)
**Wellman, Hogan** | Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction

> Provides an early conceptual framework for understanding how the internet integrates into daily routines, arguing against the "cyberspace vs. real life" dichotomy that dominated early internet studies. This framing shift — from the internet as a separate domain to the internet as embedded infrastructure — has epistemological consequences for how we study and understand digital social life.

---

### A Comparison of On and Offline Networks through the Facebook API (2009)
**Hogan** | QMSS2 Conference | 37 citations

> Compares the structural properties of online and offline ego networks, demonstrating meaningful correspondence in clustering and density. The finding that online networks are not structurally random but reflect offline social organization validates online network data as a legitimate epistemological source for understanding real social structure.

---

### Visualising and Interpreting Facebook Networks (2010)
**Hogan** | Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL | 34 citations

> Demonstrates how network visualization transforms Facebook data from flat friend lists into interpretable social structures. The act of visualization is itself an epistemological move — it makes structural patterns (cliques, bridges, isolates) visible that are present in the data but invisible in the platform's default presentation.

---

### The Relational Self-Portrait: Selfies Meet Social Networks (2014)
**Hogan, Wellman** | Society and the Internet (Oxford) | 30 citations

> The "relational self-portrait" concept captures how identity on social networking sites is constituted through connections rather than attributes alone. This is an epistemological claim about selfhood: who you are on a platform is inseparable from who you are connected to, making identity a network property rather than an individual one.

---

### Comment on Elena Pavan/1: Considering Platforms as Actors (2013)
**Hogan** | Sociologica | 6 citations

> Challenges network analysis to account for platforms as actors — not passive infrastructure but entities that actively shape the networks they host. If platforms are actors, then network analysis without accounting for platform agency produces systematically incomplete knowledge about the social structures being studied.

---

### Video Game Use, Acceptance, and Relationship Experiences (2020)
**Norton, Brown, Falbo, Hogan** | Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking | 4 citations

> Uses dyadic data from 6,756 couples across 16 countries to show that partner acceptance of video game use moderates the relationship between gaming and relationship satisfaction. The actor-partner interdependence model reveals that relationship outcomes are network properties — they emerge from the interaction between partners' behaviors and attitudes, not from individual characteristics alone.

---

### The Relationship between Zoom Use with the Camera On and Zoom Fatigue (2022)
**Ngien, Hogan** | Information, Communication & Society | 7 citations

> The mediating role of self-monitoring in camera-on fatigue reveals that video platforms create a new form of reflexive self-knowledge — constant awareness of one's own visible performance. What users "know" about themselves in a Zoom meeting is fundamentally different from what they know in a phone call, because the platform makes self-perception an unavoidable component of interaction.

---

### Assessing Structural Correlates between Friendship Networks and Conversational Agency in Facebook Groups (2015)
**Polonski, Hogan** | ICWSM | 7 citations

> Demonstrates that who speaks in Facebook groups is structured by pre-existing friendship networks, not just by topical interest or individual motivation. This finding — that conversational agency is a network property — challenges the assumption that open platforms create equal voice, revealing instead that existing social structure reproduces itself through the platform.

## 5. Teaching and Translation

Works assigned to this theme emphasize making technical work accessible and practical: pedagogy, bridging disciplines, practical guides and reference works.

---

### From Social Science to Data Science (2023)
**Hogan** | Sage Publications | Book

> A textbook that bridges social science methodology and Python programming, organized around the practical skills researchers need: working with DataFrames, accessing web data and APIs, merging and cleaning datasets, and interpreting results. Supported by Jupyter notebooks, exercises, and video tutorials, it meets social scientists where they are rather than requiring them to first become computer scientists.

---

### Analyzing Social Networks via the Internet (2008)
**Hogan** | SAGE Handbook of Online Research Methods | 245 citations

> Serves as the entry point for social researchers encountering online network analysis for the first time, translating technical concepts into accessible methodology. By appearing in a widely-used methods handbook, it ensures that social network analysis is understood as a standard tool in the online research toolkit rather than a specialist technique.

---

### Online Social Networks: Concepts for Data Collection and Analysis (2016)
**Hogan** | SAGE Handbook of Online Research Methods, 2nd ed. | 33 citations

> Updated for a landscape transformed by mobile platforms, API restrictions, and ethical concerns about user data, this chapter brings the methodological guidance into the current era. Serves as a practical bridge between the technical realities of contemporary platform architectures and the analytical needs of social researchers.

---

### Overcoming Digital Divides in Higher Education (2016)
**Radovanovic, Hogan, Lalic** | New Media & Society | 132 citations

> Offers a framework for understanding how digital literacy gaps between students and instructors can be addressed through institutional intervention. Translates the abstract concept of the "digital divide" into concrete pedagogical challenges and actionable strategies for higher education settings.

---

### Online Affairs: Information for Practitioners (2019)
**Vossler, Moller, Hogan** | Tavistock Relationships | Public resource

> Translates academic research on internet infidelity into practical guidance for relationship counsellors and therapists, addressing a documented training gap. Developed through collaboration between researchers (Open University, Oxford Internet Institute) and the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, it models how scholarly findings can be made actionable for professional practice.

---

### Facebook (encyclopedia entry) (2011)
**Hogan, Smith** | Encyclopedia of Social Networks (Sage)

> Provides an authoritative reference entry on Facebook for scholars and students across disciplines, contextualizing the platform within social network theory. Encyclopedia entries serve a distinct pedagogical function — they establish shared vocabulary and conceptual baselines for interdisciplinary audiences.

---

### Social Media (encyclopedia entry) (2015)
**Hogan, Melville** | International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences

> Defines social media for a behavioral sciences audience, establishing conceptual distinctions between platforms and prior communication technologies. Reference works of this kind shape how entire disciplines understand and teach about digital social phenomena.

---

### The Internet in Everyday Life (2004)
**Wellman, Hogan** | Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction

> An early reference work entry that helped establish the "internet in everyday life" framing for a broad audience, moving beyond the techno-utopian/dystopian binary of early internet studies. Provides accessible conceptual tools for researchers and students encountering internet studies for the first time.
