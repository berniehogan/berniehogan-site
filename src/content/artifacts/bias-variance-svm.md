Interactive demonstration of the bias-variance trade-off using a medical diagnosis scenario. Adjust the regularization parameter C to see how decision boundaries change: low C produces smooth, potentially underfitting boundaries while high C creates complex boundaries that may overfit to training data. Click to add patients and watch how the model's predictions and performance metrics respond.
