An interactive isometric triangle grid for drawing impossible objects like Penrose triangles. Click triangles to fill them with color, switch to edge mode to draw outlines, or enter triangle numbers directly. The isometric projection creates the visual grammar needed for impossible figures - shapes that appear coherent locally but contradict themselves globally.
