Interactive exploration of persistent homology concepts. Click to place nodes in the network canvas, then drag the filtration radius slider to watch the simplicial complex grow. The barcode and persistence diagrams update in real-time, showing how topological features (connected components and loops) appear and disappear as the filtration progresses.
