## Fully Unfound (Could Not Locate Abstract or Content Summary)

### 1. Me, Myself, and ID: Encoding Identities from Real Names to Deepfakes (2024)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Oxford University Press
- **Type**: Book (listed as under contract with OUP)
- **Issue**: No web presence found for this title. No OUP catalog entry, no preprint, no announcement. May still be in progress, may have changed title, or may not yet be publicly listed.
- **Action needed**: Confirm publication status, final title, and provide a summary or table of contents for annotation purposes.

## Limited Information (Annotation Written from Indirect Sources)

### 2. Interactive Mapping of Wikipedia's Geographies (2012)
- **Authors**: Gareth Baily, Bernie Hogan, Mark Graham, Ahmed Medhat
- **Venue**: WikiSym '12
- **Issue**: Could not find the specific conference paper. Found references to the underlying interactive mapping project through Graham's broader Wikipedia geographies research, but the specific paper's abstract and methodology are unverified.
- **Action needed**: Confirm paper content and key contributions distinct from the 2014 Annals paper on the same topic.

### 3. Using Social Metadata in Email Triage (2007)
- **Authors**: Danyel Fisher, A. J. Brush, Bernie Hogan, Marc A. Smith, Andy Jacobs
- **Venue**: Human Interface and the Management of Information (Springer)
- **Issue**: Initial web search returned no results. Annotation was written based on the known context of Hogan and Fisher's Microsoft Research collaboration on email management and social sorting. The specific paper content is not directly verified.
- **Action needed**: Confirm the paper's specific contributions — does it focus on the "social sorting" approach to email triage? What specific metadata features were used?

### 4. Mixing in Social Media (2015)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Social Media + Society
- **DOI**: 10.1177/2056305115580482
- **Issue**: Found the DOI and basic metadata but could not access the abstract or detailed content. The vinyl records analogy reference came from a brief snippet. Annotation may need revision.
- **Action needed**: Verify the vinyl records analogy is central to the paper, confirm the "many-to-many affordances" framing, and check if the paper makes additional arguments not captured in the annotation.

### 5. Comment on Elena Pavan/1: Considering Platforms as Actors (2013)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Sociologica
- **DOI**: 10.2383/75767
- **Issue**: Found the citation and topic keywords (social media, social networks, constructivism, APIs, personalization) but could not access the full text or a detailed abstract. Annotation is based on the title and keywords.
- **Action needed**: Verify the specific argument about platforms as network actors. Is this primarily a response to Pavan's network analysis approach, or does it make independent theoretical claims?

### 6. The Immanent Internet (2004)
- **Authors**: Barry Wellman, Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Netting Citizens (St Andrew's Press)
- **Issue**: Found the general concept (internet becoming embedded in everyday life, networked individualism) but limited direct information about the specific arguments in this chapter vs. the 2011 Redux version.
- **Action needed**: Clarify what the original 2004 chapter argues distinctly from the 2011 update, particularly regarding the "immanent" framing.

### 7. The Internet in Everyday Life (2004)
- **Authors**: Barry Wellman, Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction
- **Issue**: Encyclopedia entry — no abstract available. Annotation is based on the title and known Wellman-Hogan research themes of this era.
- **Action needed**: Brief confirmation of content scope.

### 8. Facebook (encyclopedia entry) (2011)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan, Marc A. Smith
- **Venue**: Encyclopedia of Social Networks (Sage)
- **Issue**: Encyclopedia entry — standard reference work, no abstract available. Annotation is based on expected scope.
- **Action needed**: Brief confirmation of content scope and key points.

### 9. Social Media (encyclopedia entry) (2015)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan, Joshua Melville
- **Venue**: International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2nd Edition
- **DOI**: 10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.95073-6
- **Issue**: Encyclopedia entry — limited content available. Annotation is based on expected scope.
- **Action needed**: Brief confirmation of content scope and key distinctions drawn.

### 10. P257 Online Partner Seeking as a Social Practice (2021)
- **Authors**: David Reid, Chris Bonell, Ruth Lewis, Bernie Hogan, Kirstin Mitchell, Raquel Bosó Pérez, Wendy Macdowall
- **Venue**: Sexually Transmitted Infections (conference abstract)
- **Issue**: This appears to be a conference abstract version of the full 2022 Journal of Sex Research paper (same DOI). It may not need a separate annotation.
- **Action needed**: Confirm whether this conference abstract should have its own entry or be merged with the full paper.

### 11. Was Facebook's Decision to Cut Off Third-Party Developers Genuinely Virtuous? (2018)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: New Statesman
- **Issue**: Could not find the specific article in search results. The URL listed in the site data (https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/facebook-third-party-data) may be broken or paywalled. Annotation is based on the title and known context (post-Cambridge Analytica API restrictions).
- **Action needed**: Verify URL works, confirm article content matches annotation.

### 12. How Facebook Divides Us (2016)
- **Authors**: Bernie Hogan
- **Venue**: Times Literary Supplement
- **Issue**: Found indirect references (OII list of recommended reads on filter bubbles), including a specific quote about Facebook filtering friends' views. The TLS URL (https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/facebook-trump-brexit/) may be paywalled.
- **Action needed**: Verify URL works, confirm full argument of the piece.

## Notes on Annotation Quality

### High Confidence Annotations (content directly verified via abstract/full text)
- All papers with DOIs that returned abstracts on publisher sites
- All SSRN-hosted preprints
- All PubMed-indexed papers
- All papers with detailed Semantic Scholar or ResearchGate summaries

### Medium Confidence Annotations (content inferred from partial information)
- Papers where only brief snippets or secondary citations were available
- Book chapters where the book's table of contents was available but not the chapter abstract
- Public-facing pieces (TLS, New Statesman) where only partial content was accessible

### Lower Confidence Annotations (content extrapolated from title and context)
- Encyclopedia entries (items 7-9 above)
- The unreleased book (item 1)
- Conference abstracts that duplicate full papers (item 10)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Priority review**: Items 1 (Me, Myself, and ID) and 2 (WikiSym paper) need the most attention as content is genuinely unknown.
2. **Quick verification**: Items 3-6 likely have accurate annotations but would benefit from a brief check against the actual text.
3. **Consider merging**: Item 10 (P257 conference abstract) appears to be a duplicate of the full paper and may not need a separate entry.
4. **URL check**: Items 11 and 12 (public-facing journalism) should have their URLs tested for accessibility.
